### ‚ö†Ô∏è Penalty System
VitaCoin implements a fair penalty system to encourage consistent engagement and learning habits.

#### Types of Penalties
- **Missed Login Penalty**
  - **10 coins** deducted for each missed day
  - **Login streak resets to 0** when missing a day
  - Maximum of 30 days of penalties applied at once
  - Applied automatically on next login
  - Each penalty is recorded with the specific date it applies to
  - Previous streak length is preserved in transaction history for reference

- **Missed Quiz Penalty**
  - **10 coins** deducted for each day without completing a quiz
  - Separate penalties for each quiz category
  - Applied automatically when checking daily progress

#### Key Features
- **No Negative Balance** - Penalties won't reduce your coins below zero
- **Detailed Transaction History** - Each penalty is logged with date and reason
- **Streak Reset** - Missing a day resets your login streak to 0
- **Transparent Tracking** - Transaction history shows both penalties and streak resets
- **Streak Protection** - Maintain your streaks to avoid penalties
- **Transparent System** - All penalties are clearly visible in your transaction history

#### How Penalties Work
1. **Login Penalties**
   - Checked when you log in
   - Applies to all days since your last login (up to 30 days)
   - Each missed day incurs a 10-coin penalty

2. **Quiz Penalties**
   - Checked daily at 23:59 IST
   - Applies to each category where no quiz was completed
   - Each missed category incurs a 10-coin penalty

#### Avoiding Penalties
1. **Log in daily** to maintain your login streak and avoid login penalties
2. **Complete at least one quiz per day** to avoid quiz penalties
3. **Check the app regularly** to stay on top of your learning goals
4. **View your transaction history** to track any penalties applied

#### Example Scenario
If you miss 3 days of logins and quizzes:
- **Day 1 Missed**: 10 coins penalty (login) + 10 coins (quiz) = 20 coins
- **Day 2 Missed**: 10 coins penalty (login) + 10 coins (quiz) = 20 coins
- **Day 3 Missed**: 10 coins penalty (login) + 10 coins (quiz) = 20 coins

Total penalty: **60 coins** (recorded as separate transactions for each day)

#### Viewing Penalties
All penalties are visible in your transaction history with the following details:
- Date of the penalty
- Amount deducted
- Reason (e.g., "Missed login penalty")
- Category (for quiz penalties)

### Firebase Configuration

1. Create a new project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Authentication with Email/Password and Google providers
3. Set up Firestore database in production mode
4. Configure your Firebase project:
   - Go to Project Settings
   - Under "Your apps", add a new web app
   - Copy the configuration object

5. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your Firebase config:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-bucket.appspot.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser
3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Firebase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-firebase-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id

# SendGrid Configuration (Optional)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-api-key
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 4. Initialize Sample Data

Run the initialization script to populate your Firebase with sample quiz questions and badges:

```bash
npx tsx src/scripts/initializeData.ts
```

This will add:
- 20 quiz questions across 4 categories (Math, Aptitude, Grammar, Programming)
- 16 badges (5 purchasable + 11 achievement badges)

### 5. Firebase Security Rules

Update your Firestore security rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      
      // Allow reading other users' public data for leaderboard
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      
      // Subcollections
      match /{subcollection=**} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      }
    }
    
    // Public collections
    match /badges/{document} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    match /quizQuestions/{document} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
